FRONTEND - MIDDLE_END - BACKEND
- We need an intermediate layer between the client and the micorservices
- Using this middle end , when client sends request we will be able to make     decision  that which microservices should actually respond to this request
- we can do message validation , response transformation and rate limiting
- we try to prepare the api gateway that acts as this middle end.
